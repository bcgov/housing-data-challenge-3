35,This is a total population estimate.  The sum of the ethnic groups in this table is greater than the total population estimate because a person may report more than one ethnic origin in the NHS.
36,Includes general responses indicating North American origins (e.g. 'North American') as well as more specific responses indicating North American origins that have not been included elsewhere (e.g. 'Maritimer' 'Manitoban').
37,Includes general responses indicating British Isles origins (e.g. 'British' 'United Kingdom') as well as more specific responses indicating British Isles origins that have not been included elsewhere (e.g. 'Celtic').

46,Includes general responses indicating North African origins (e.g. 'North African') as well as more specific responses indicating North African origins that have not been included elsewhere (e.g. 'Maghreb').
47,Includes general responses indicating Southern or East African origins (e.g. 'East African') as well as more specific responses indicating Southern or East African origins that have not been included elsewhere (e.g. 'Hutu' 'Shona').
48,Some respondents may choose to provide very specific ethnic origins in the National Household Survey (NHS) while other respondents may choose to give more general responses. This means that two respondents with the same ethnic ancestry could have different response patterns and thus could be counted as having different ethnic origins. For example one respondent may report 'East Indian' ethnic origin while another respondent with a similar ancestral background may report 'Punjabi' or 'South Asian' origins; one respondent may report 'Black' while another similar respondent may report 'Ghanaian' or 'African.' As a result ethnic origin data are very fluid and counts for certain origins such as 'East Indian' and 'Black' may seem lower than initially expected. Users who wish to obtain broader response counts may wish to combine data for one or more ethnic origins together or use counts for ethnic categories such as 'South Asian origins' or 'African origins.' (Please note however that 'African origins' should not be considered equivalent to the 'Black' population group or visible minority status as there are persons reporting African origins who report a population group or visible minority status other than 'Black.' Conversely many people report a population group or visible minority status of 'Black' and do not report having 'African' origins. For information on population group and visible minority population in the 2011 NHS refer to the appropriate definitions in this publication.)
49,Includes general responses indicating Other African origins (e.g. 'African') as well as more specific responses indicating Other African origins that have not been included elsewhere (e.g. 'Saharan').
50,Includes general responses indicating West Asian Central Asian and Middle Eastern origins (e.g. 'West Asian' 'Middle Eastern') as well as more specific responses indicating West Asian Central Asian and Middle Eastern origins that have not been included elsewhere (e.g. 'Baloch' 'Circassian').
51,Includes general responses indicating South Asian origins (e.g. 'South Asian') as well as more specific responses indicating South Asian origins that have not been included elsewhere (e.g. 'Bhutanese').

Aboriginal peoples of Canada are defined in the Constitution Act 1982 section 35 (2) as including the Indian Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada.
57,Users should be aware that the estimates associated with this variable are more affected than most by the incomplete enumeration of certain Indian reserves and Indian settlements in the National Household Survey (NHS). In 2011 there were a total of 36 Indian reserves and Indian settlements that were 'incompletely enumerated' in the NHS. For these reserves or settlements NHS enumeration was either not permitted or was interrupted before it could be completed or was not possible because of natural events (specifically forest fires in Northern Ontario). For additional information please refer to the Aboriginal Peoples Reference Guide National Household Survey (NHS) 2011.
58,'Multiple Aboriginal identities' includes persons who reported being any two or all three of the following: First Nations (North American Indian) Métis or Inuk (Inuit).

Registered or Treaty Indian' includes persons who reported being a Registered or Treaty Indian in Question 20. Registered Indians are persons who are registered under the Indian Act of Canada. Treaty Indians are persons who belong to a First Nation or Indian band that signed a treaty with the Crown. Registered or Treaty Indians are sometimes also called Status Indians.
61,This is a total population estimate. The sum of the ancestries in this table is greater than the total population estimate because a person may report more than one ancestry (ethnic origin) in the National Household Survey.
62,'Aboriginal ancestry' includes persons who reported one or more than one of First Nations (North American Indian) Métis or Inuit ancestry in Question 17 either with or without also reporting a non-Aboriginal ancestry.  The sum of the categories 'First Nations (North American Indian) ancestry' 'Métis ancestry' and 'Inuit ancestry' is thus greater than the sum of the total for 'Aboriginal ancestry' because persons who reported more than one Aboriginal ancestry are included in the response category for each Aboriginal ancestry they reported. All respondents with Aboriginal ancestry are counted in at least one of the categories 'First Nations (North American Indian) ancestry' 'Métis ancestry' and 'Inuit ancestry' and also in the category 'Aboriginal ancestry.' Aboriginal peoples of Canada are defined in the Constitution Act 1982 section 35 (2) as including the Indian Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada. Ancestry refers to the ethnic or cultural origins of the respondent's ancestors an ancestor being usually more distant than a grandparent. A person can have more than one ethnic or cultural origin.
63,'Non-Aboriginal ancestry only' includes persons who did not report First Nations (North American Indian) Métis or Inuit ancestry in Question 17.
64,Refers to languages other than English or French in which the respondent can conduct a conversation. The category 'Non-official languages spoken' represents the sum of single language responses and multiple language responses received in the National Household Survey. Hence this total is greater than the total population.
65,Cree languages include the following categories: Cree not otherwise specified (which refers to those who reported 'Cree') Swampy Cree Plains Cree Woods Cree and a category labelled 'Cree not included elsewhere' (which includes Moose Cree Northern East Cree and Southern East Cree).
66,This is a subtotal of all Aboriginal languages collected on May 10 2011 that are not displayed separately here.

Persons who have not moved are referred to as non-movers and persons who have moved from one residence to another are referred to as movers. Movers include non-migrants and migrants. Non-migrants are persons who did move but remained in the same city town township village or Indian reserve. Migrants include internal migrants who moved to a different city town township village or Indian reserve within Canada. External migrants include persons who lived outside Canada at the earlier reference date.
69,Refers to the status of a person with regard to the place of residence on the reference day May 10 2011 in relation to the place of residence on the same date five years earlier. Persons who have not moved are referred to as non-movers and persons who have moved from one residence to another are referred to as movers. Movers include non-migrants and migrants. Non-migrants are persons who did move but remained in the same city town township village or Indian reserve. Migrants include internal migrants who moved to a different city town township village or Indian reserve within Canada. External migrants include persons who lived outside Canada at the earlier reference date.
70,'Highest certificate diploma or degree' refers to the highest certificate diploma or degree completed based on a hierarchy which is generally related to the amount of time spent 'in-class.' For postsecondary completers a university education is considered to be a higher level of schooling than a college education while a college education is considered to be a higher level of education than in the trades. Although some trades requirements may take as long or longer to complete than a given college or university program the majority of time is spent in on-the-job paid training and less time is spent in the classroom. For further definitions refer to the National Household Survey Dictionary Catalogue no. 99-000-X. For any comments on collection dissemination or data quality for this variable refer to the Education Reference Guide National Household Survey Catalogue no. 99-012-X2011006.
71,'High school diploma or equivalent' includes persons who have graduated from a secondary school or equivalent. It excludes persons with a postsecondary certificate diploma or degree.
72,'Postsecondary certificate diploma or degree' includes 'apprenticeship or trades certificates or diplomas' 'college CEGEP or other non-university certificates or diplomas' and university certificates diplomas and degrees.
73,'Apprenticeship or trades certificate or diploma' includes Registered Apprenticeship certificates (including Certificate of Qualification Journeyperson's designation) and other trades certificates or diplomas such as pre-employment or vocational certificates and diplomas from brief trade programs completed at community colleges institutes of technology vocational centres and similar institutions.
74,Comparisons with other data sources suggest that the category 'University certificate or diploma below the bachelor's level' was over-reported in the NHS. This category likely includes some responses that are actually college certificates or diplomas bachelor's degrees or other types of education (e.g. university transfer programs bachelor's programs completed in other countries incomplete bachelor's programs non-university professional designations). We recommend users interpret the results for the 'University certificate or diploma below the bachelor's level' category with caution.
75,'University certificate diploma or degree above bachelor level' includes the categories 'University certificate or diploma above bachelor level' 'Degree in medicine dentistry veterinary medicine or optometry' 'Master's degree' and 'Earned doctorate.'

80,'Location of study compared with province or territory of residence' indicates whether the 'Location of study' is the same as the province or territory of residence in 2011 a different Canadian province or territory or outside Canada. 'Location of study' refers to the province territory or country of the institution where the highest certificate diploma or degree above the high school level was completed. Users should be aware that some respondents may have reported the physical location of study rather than the location of the certificate diploma or degree-granting institution. This could affect the responses of those who obtained a certificate diploma or degree through a joint program or by distance learning with credentials granted in another province or country. In particular a number of persons reported a location of study for a university credential in one of the territories (Yukon Northwest Territories Nunavut) even though there were no educational institutions in the territories with the authority to grant university degrees.  For any other comments on collection dissemination or data quality for this variable or 'Location of study' refer to the Education Reference Guide National Household Survey Catalogue no. 99-012-X2011006.

105,Household maintainer - Refers to whether or not a person residing in the household is responsible for paying the rent or the mortgage or the taxes or the electricity or other services or utilities. Where a number of people may contribute to the payments more than one person in the household may be identified as a household maintainer. If no person in the household is identified as making such payments the reference person is identified by default.
106,Primary household maintainer - First person in the household identified as someone who pays the rent or the mortgage or the taxes or the electricity bill and so on for the dwelling. The order of the persons in a household is determined by the order in which the respondent lists the persons on the questionnaire. Generally an adult is listed first followed if applicable by that person's spouse or common-law partner and by their children.

107,Persons per room - Refers to an indicator of the level of crowding in a private dwelling. It is calculated by dividing the number of persons in the household by the number of rooms in the dwelling.
108,Housing suitability - Housing suitability refers to whether a private household is living in suitable accommodations according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS); that is whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of the household. A household is deemed to be living in suitable accommodations if its dwelling has enough bedrooms as calculated using the National Occupancy Standard. Housing suitability assesses the required number of bedrooms for a household based on the age sex and relationships among household members. An alternative variable the number of persons per room considers all rooms in a private dwelling and the number of household members. Housing suitability and the National Occupancy Standard (NOS) on which it is based were developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through consultations with provincial housing agencies.
109,Shelter-cost-to-income ratio - Percentage of a household's average total monthly income which is spent on shelter-related expenses. Those expenses include the monthly rent (for tenants) or the mortgage payment property taxes and condominium fees (for owners) and the costs of electricity heat municipal services etc. The percentage is calculated by dividing the total shelter-related expenses by the household's total monthly income and multiplying the result by 100. Includes owner and tenant households in non-farm non-reserve private dwellings with household total income greater than zero in 2010 (i.e. excludes negative or zero household total income). The relatively high shelter costs to household income ratios for some households may have resulted from the difference in the reference period for shelter costs and household total income data. The reference period for shelter cost data is 2011 while household total income is reported for the year 2010. As well for some households the 2010 household total income may represent income for only part of a year. Household total income - The total income of a household is the sum of the total incomes of all members of that household. Total income refers to the total of income from all sources including employment income income from government programs pension income investment income and any other money income before income taxes and deductions during the calendar year 2010.

Includes owner households in non-farm non-reserve private dwellings with household total income greater than zero in 2010 (i.e. excludes negative or zero household total income). The relatively high shelter costs to household income ratios for some households may have resulted from the difference in the reference period for shelter costs and household total income data. The reference period for shelter cost data is 2011 while household total income is reported for the year 2010. As well for some households the 2010 household total income may represent income for only part of a year. Household total income - The total income of a household is the sum of the total incomes of all members of that household. Total income refers to the total of income from all sources including employment income income from government programs pension income investment income and any other money income before income taxes and deductions during the calendar year 2010.

115,Shelter-cost-to-income ratio for tenant households - Percentage of a tenant household's average total monthly income which is spent on shelter-related expenses. Those expenses include the monthly rent and the costs of electricity heat municipal services etc. The percentage is calculated by dividing the total shelter-related expenses by the household's total monthly income and multiplying the result by 100. Includes tenant households in non-farm non-reserve private dwellings with household total income greater than zero in 2010 (i.e. excludes negative or zero household total income). The relatively high shelter costs to household income ratios for some households may have resulted from the difference in the reference period for shelter costs and household total income data. The reference period for shelter cost data is 2011 while household total income is reported for the year 2010. As well for some households the 2010 household total income may represent income for only part of a year. Household total income - The total income of a household is the sum of the total incomes of all members of that household.

It excludes one-time receipts such as lottery winnings gambling winnings cash inheritances lump sum insurance settlements capital gains and RRSP withdrawals. Capital gains are excluded because they are not by their nature regular and recurring. It is further assumed that they are less likely to be fully spent in the period in which they are received unlike income that is regular and recurring. Also excluded are employer's contributions to registered pension plans Canada and Quebec pension plans and employment insurance. Finally voluntary inter-household transfers imputed rent goods and services produced for barter and goods produced for own consumption are excluded from this total income definition.

153,Income status can be measured in several different ways in household surveys. For the standard products of the National Household Survey the line chosen is a relative measure: the after-tax low-income measure (LIM-AT). For this measure the income used is after-tax income of households. There are no regional variations to account for prices or cost of living differences: all applicable households in Canada face the same line adjusted for household size. This line is set at half the median of adjusted household after-tax income. To account for potential economies of scale the income of households with more than one member is divided by the square root of the size of the household.  All household members are considered to share the household income and are attributed the same income status.  Note: Low-income estimates in the 2011 National Household Survey. For the 2011 National Household Survey (NHS) low-income statistics are presented based on the after-tax low-income measure (LIM-AT). This measure is not related to the low-income cut-offs (LICO) presented in the 2006 Census and prevalence rates are conceptually not comparable. Because of the sensitivity of certain income indicators to differences in methodology and response patterns direct comparisons to establish trends with low-income estimates from other household surveys administrative programs or the 2006 Census are discouraged. The prevalence rates observed in the NHS at the national level are generally 1 to 2 percentage points higher than seen for similar concepts in other programs. However analysis of the NHS data suggests that it is valid to compare low-income data for different sub-populations within the NHS (i.e. for different geographic areas or demographic groups). For more information refer to the Income Reference Guide National Household Survey Catalogue no. 99-014-X2011006. Age - Refers to the age at last birthday before the reference date that is before May 10 2011.
