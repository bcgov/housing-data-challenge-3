"This file was originally assembled from information on institutions’ websites. For each update of the file the existing list is checked to confirm that the listed locations are still open; as well, new locations are identified from institution websites and added to the list. Longitude and latitude are collected from the address bar of the Google Maps search result for a location’s address."
